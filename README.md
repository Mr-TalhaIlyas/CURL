# Contrastive Representation Learning for Fetal Movement Assessment

Contrastive Ultrasound Video Representation Learning (CURL) is a novel self-supervised framework designed for fetal movement detection from extended ultrasound video recordings. Our method employs a dual-contrastive loss that captures both spatial and temporal features, enabling the model to learn robust motion representations. We also introduce a task-specific sampling strategy that effectively distinguishes between movement and non-movement segments during training. Additionally, CURL supports flexible inference on ultrasound recordings of arbitrary length through a probabilistic fine-tuning approach.
